# SwingTicTacToe
TicTacToe GUI game using java swing library

This is a GUI application I wrote mainly to showcase my coding style and design process. Written in java, the codebase utilizes the swing library for the various UI elements. The app is a simple 2 player TicTacToe game with one controller (so no computer AI or remote player).

The game randomizes which player starts first and periodically checks for a winner. If the cells are all place then the game results in a tie. No current scoring feature is implemented but may be added later. The initial goal was a simple game rather than a tournament style showdown. Below are some screencaps of the game.
